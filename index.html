      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a college graduate with a Bachelor's in International Business Administration. Since I was young I have been interested in working with computers and now I want to learn more skills to help me work in a field that I actually enjoy.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Miami, FL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy home brewing beer and investing in the stock market during my freetime.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a Front End Developer for a well recognized company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Miami, FL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As I said before I have always liked working with computers and now I am eager to learn more about the world of computers. Web development is the best way to learn more about computers especially because so many people use the internet just to look through websites. I hope to one day have my work on a website so that I can show the people close to me.</p>
